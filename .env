    ### General Objective:

    # To analyze and visualize the effects of weather conditions and treatment practices on the completion of tasks related to plant growth, specifically garlic planting, through the use of line graphs, weather forecasting data, and AI models. Additionally, to develop a decision support system that recommends optimal treatments for fertilizer application and pest/disease control.

    # ### Specific Objectives:

    # 1. **Comparison of Weather Conditions and Task Completion:**

    # * To create a line graph comparing the effects of good vs. bad weather on the completion of tasks, using weather forecast data (including average temperature, wind speed, humidity, and precipitation).
    # 2. **Comparison of Treatment Practices vs. Uncompleted Tasks:**

    # * To develop a line graph to compare the effects of different treatment practices on task completion, based on weather forecast data for the day (average temperature, wind speed, humidity, and precipitation).
    # 3. **Comparison of Active Treatment vs. Uncompleted Tasks:**

    # * To generate a line graph comparing the impact of actively treating plants vs. tasks that remain uncompleted, considering the day’s weather forecast (temperature range, wind speed, humidity, and precipitation).
    # 4. **Development of an AI Model for Garlic Planting:**

    # * To build and train an AI model using logged data to predict the success of garlic planting based on weather and treatment variables, aiming to improve the decision-making process and enhance planting success.
    # 5. **Decision Support System for Treatment Recommendations:**

    # * To develop a decision support system that utilizes weather forecast data (temperature, wind, humidity, and precipitation) for generating recommendations on when and how to apply fertilizer and manage pest and disease treatments for optimal plant health.
